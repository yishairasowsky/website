            We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean
            when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.

            we may publish from time to time on the Website.
        </li>
        <li>
            The "Service" refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Bitwarden.

            provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement,
            the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
        </li>

    <h3>
        <a id="b-account-terms" class="anchor" href="#b-account-terms" aria-hidden="true"></a>B. Account Terms
    </h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Short version:</strong>
        <em>
            A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not
            have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are
            signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.
        </em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <a id="1-required-information" class="anchor" href="#1-required-information" aria-hidden="true"></a>
        1. Required Information
    </p>

    <p>
        You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested,
        such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case
        we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#k-payment">paid account</a>,
        in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a id="2-account-requirements" class="anchor" href="#2-account-requirements" aria-hidden="true"></a>
        2. Account Requirements
    </p>

    <p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on Bitwarden's Service.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not
            permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
            One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young people take an interest in our Service,
            we must comply with United States law. Bitwarden does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not
            permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will
            <a href="#l-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User's account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a
            country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for
            complying with your country's laws.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid
            organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.
        </li>
        <li>Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <a id="3-user-account-security" class="anchor" href="#3-user-account-security" aria-hidden="true"></a>
        3. User Account Security
    </p>

    <p>
        You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor
        authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security
        are up to you.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is
            posted by others who have accounts under your account).
        </li>
        <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Bitwarden cannot and will not be
            liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will promptly <a href="https://bitwarden.com/contact">notify Bitwarden</a> if you become aware of any
            unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your
            password or account.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <a id="4-additional-terms" class="anchor" href="#4-additional-terms" aria-hidden="true"></a>
        4. Additional Terms
    </p>

    <p>
        In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of Bitwarden. For example, you may be a member of an
        organization on Bitwarden with its own terms or license agreements; or you may download an application that integrates
        with Bitwarden. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern
        their relationships with you.
