        <p><b>Your IP address has been temporarily blocked from accessing Bitwarden's cloud infrastructure.</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>This could have happened for several reasons, such as rate limiting abuse of our APIs.</p>
        <p>If this block was triggered due to a false positive in our abuse detection systems, we apologize. We are
            working
            to fine tune these detection systems to ensure the quality and integrity of Bitwarden's cloud services for
            all.</p>
        <p>This block is only temporary and will automatically expire after ~30 minutes.</p>
        <p>You can reach Bitwarden support directly via email at support@bitwarden.com.</p>
